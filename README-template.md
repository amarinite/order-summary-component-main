## My process

Second completed challenge and although it was simple, it still had a few challenges.

For the card elements, I used Flexbox because this way I could easily set an even gap between elements. I wanted to use CSS Grid to build the (in my opinion) trickiest section, the Plan info. Grid allowed me to distribute the columns in a flexible way (I took advantadge of the proportional measurements for the colums and used a 20fr 60fr 20fr distribution for the 3 items), also it made things a little bit easier with the responsive version, as I could ajust the gap easily, so I think this was the better option. I also used Flexbox to separate the text inside the Plan info, which is maybe unnecessary, but I thought it would be better to use the gap attribute rather than margin.

For the media queries, I chose the breakpoints based on the design. They're small adjustments, but still I only needed to add a couple of breakpoints.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was really useful to start familiarizing myself with Grid and Flexbox, even though I still feel like I need a lot of practice. Also, I feel that, even though I got to the solution, I feel unsure about the process. There's probably a lot of best practices I'm not following and my code probably looks messier than it needs to be, so I'm looking forward to compare my code to others.

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on practicing layouts and also start thinking about clean code and best practices.
